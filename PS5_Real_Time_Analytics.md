# Problem Statement 5: Real-Time Analytics

## Goal
Simulate real-time decision-making for race engineers, optimizing pit windows, responding to race conditions, and making strategic calls using historical pattern recognition.

---

## Core Questions

### Pit Stop Strategy
- When is the optimal pit window?
- Should we pit now or stay out?
- What is the expected position after pit stop?
- How does tire age compare to competitors?

### Caution Flag Response
- Should we pit under caution?
- What is the track position implication?
- What restart position can we expect?
- Do we have tire advantage/disadvantage?

### Pace Management
- What is the target lap time for tire/fuel management?
- Are we on pace to achieve our race goal?
- How is tire degradation tracking vs expectations?

### Gap Management
- Can we catch the car ahead (closing rate analysis)?
- Is the car behind a threat (pace differential)?
- What is the time delta required for position change?

### Performance Monitoring
- Is the driver off-pace (anomaly detection)?
- Are there sector-specific performance drops?
- Is there a potential car issue indicated by telemetry?

### Strategic Options
- What are our strategic options at this point in the race?
- What are the probability-weighted outcomes for each option?
- How do competitors' strategies affect our optimal decision?

### Competitor Tracking
- What strategies are competitors running?
- Who is the threat/opportunity?
- What are the pit cycle predictions?

✅ Pit recommendations are data-backed and accurate
✅ Performance alerts trigger at appropriate thresholds
✅ Scenario simulator shows probability-weighted outcomes
✅ Gap management tools are intuitive and actionable
✅ Competitor tracking provides strategic insights

### Phase 5 Demo Script

"Within the Analytics module, we've added a Real-Time Simulator that lets you replay any race and make strategic decisions lap-by-lap. The system shows you the race state as if it's happening live - current gaps, tire age, position.

At any decision point, get recommendations: should you pit now or stay out? See time gain/loss projections and position change estimates. Performance alerts warn you if a driver is off-pace. The scenario simulator lets you explore 'what-if' alternatives - what if we pitted 2 laps earlier? The Monte Carlo simulation shows probability-weighted outcomes for different strategies."
