# Problem Statement 1: Driver & Track Profiling System

## Goal
Create FIFA Ultimate Team-style visual cards for all drivers and tracks that display key stats, strengths, and ratings at a glance. Users click on side navigation to see a grid of cards, then click individual cards to drill into detailed profiles.

---

## Driver Profile Questions

- What is each driver's unique driving style signature?
- Which track types suit each driver best (technical vs high-speed vs mixed)?
- What are each driver's strengths and weaknesses across different skill dimensions?
- How consistent is each driver across different conditions and tracks?
- What is each driver's learning rate and improvement trajectory?
- How does each driver perform under different weather conditions?

---

## Track Profile Questions

- What are the defining characteristics of each track?
- What are the best sector times, lap times, and speed records per track?
- Which corners/sectors are most challenging (highest variance)?
- How do environmental conditions affect performance at each track?
- What driving style is most successful at each track?
- How similar/different are tracks to each other?

---

## Cross-Track Performance Analysis

- Which drivers dominate at which tracks?
- Are there track-type specialists (technical vs high-speed)?
- Does track length correlate with driver performance patterns?

---

## Learning Curve & Adaptation

- Which drivers improve most from Race 1 to Race 2 at each venue?
- What is the average learning rate across all drivers?
- Do setup changes between R1 and R2 show measurable performance impact?

---

## Environmental Comparative Analysis

- How does altitude affect performance across venues?
- What is the optimal temperature range for fastest lap times?
- Which tracks are most weather-sensitive?

---

## Championship-Level Insights

- Does consistency or raw speed matter more for championship success?
- How do performance gaps evolve throughout the season?
- What is the correlation between qualifying and race performance?

---

## Track Characteristic Clustering

- Can we group tracks into meaningful categories?
- Which tracks have transferable skills?
- How complex is each track (quantified difficulty metric)?
