## Core Questions

### Qualifying Result Prediction
- Can we predict qualifying results for upcoming races?
- Which factors best predict qualifying performance?
- What are the confidence intervals for top 5 predictions?

### Race Pace Forecasting
- What will be the expected race-winning pace?
- Which drivers will have the strongest race pace?
- How will qualifying pace translate to race pace?

### Tire Degradation Modeling
- How will tire degradation affect race strategy?
- What is the expected lap time degradation per stint?
- What is the optimal tire strategy?

### Driver Form & Performance
- Which drivers will perform best based on track type?
- How does recent form and momentum affect predictions?
- Can we model driver learning rates for Race 2 predictions?

### Weather Impact
- How will predicted weather conditions impact performance?
- What is the optimal temperature range for each driver?
- Which drivers perform best in different conditions?

### Strategy Optimization
- What is the optimal pit strategy given historical data?
- What are the expected pit windows?
- How do different strategies compare (probability-weighted)?

### Track Similarity Transfer
- Can performance at similar tracks predict performance at new venues?
- How accurate is Track A data for predicting Track B outcomes?
- Which historical races are most relevant for prediction?

✅ Prediction confidence intervals are displayed and reasonable
✅ Strategy recommendations are data-backed and actionable
✅ Weather impact is quantified and integrated into predictions
✅ Track similarity engine provides relevant historical comparisons

### Phase 3 Demo Script

"Our Predictions module uses historical data from all 12 championship races to forecast upcoming performance. Before Race 2, we analyze Race 1 results, driver form trajectories, and track similarity patterns to predict qualifying order with confidence intervals.

See expected race pace for each driver, optimal pit strategies, and how weather conditions will impact performance. The track similarity engine identifies which previous races are most relevant - for example, if you performed well at Barber's technical sections, we predict strong performance at similar corners in Sonoma."
