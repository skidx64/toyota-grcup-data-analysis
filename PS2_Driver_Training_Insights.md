# Problem Statement 2: Driver Training & Insights

## Goal
Create actionable training tools that help drivers identify specific improvement areas and optimize racing lines using multi-track comparative analysis.

---

## Core Questions

### Performance Gap Analysis
- Where is a driver losing time compared to the fastest driver (sector-by-sector)?
- Which specific corners have the highest time loss?
- How does lap time variance indicate consistency issues?

### Racing Line Optimization
- How does a driver's racing line differ from the optimal line?
- Are entry/apex/exit points optimal?
- Where is the driver taking a longer/shorter path?

### Driver Input Quality
- Are throttle applications optimal and consistent?
- Are braking zones consistent and effective?
- Is steering input smooth or corrective?

### Vehicle Dynamics Utilization
- Is the driver utilizing the car's full performance envelope (G-forces)?
- Are gear selections optimal?
- What is the speed differential at key track positions?

### Improvement Prioritization
- Which specific corners/sectors have the highest improvement potential?
- What is the time gain opportunity per improvement area?
- Can techniques from strong tracks be transferred to weak tracks?

### Season Progression
- How has the driver improved across the season on specific skills?
- Which skills show the most/least improvement?
- Is the driver closing the gap to leaders?

---

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

✅ "Training" navigation is clickable and active
✅ Driver can select themselves and see top 5 improvement areas
✅ Racing line overlay shows GPS trajectory vs fastest lap
✅ Sector delta analysis identifies specific time loss areas
✅ Input quality scorecards provide actionable feedback
✅ Progress tracking shows improvement (or decline) across season
✅ Recommendations are prioritized by time-gain potential

### Phase 2 Demo Script

"Now with our Training module unlocked, drivers can get deep insights into their performance. Select any driver and see exactly where they're losing time - sector by sector, corner by corner. The racing line comparison tool overlays your GPS trajectory against the fastest lap, color-coded by speed differential.

You'll see prioritized improvement recommendations like 'Focus on Turn 5 braking - potential 0.3s gain' with specific coaching points. Track your skill progression across all 12 races to see which areas are improving and which need more focus. Input quality scorecards rate your throttle, braking, and steering consistency against the top drivers."
