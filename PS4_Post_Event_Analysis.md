# Problem Statement 4: Post-Event Analysis

## Goal
Tell the complete story of each race beyond final standings, revealing key moments, strategic decisions, and performance patterns that determined outcomes.

---

## Core Questions

### Race Narrative
- What were the defining moments of each race?
- When did the race outcome get decided?
- What were the key position changes and battles?

### Strategic Analysis
- How did strategies (pit timing, tire choices) affect outcomes?
- Which strategic decisions were optimal vs suboptimal?
- Did track position or pace determine success?

### Performance Evaluation
- Who had the strongest race pace vs who maximized position?
- How consistent were drivers throughout the race?
- What separated podium finishers from the rest of the field?

### Incident & Flag Impact
- How did caution flags and incidents impact the race?
- What was the restart performance comparison?
- How did traffic affect clean vs dirty air pace?

### Track Conditions
- How did track conditions evolve during the race?
- What was the grip level progression?
- How did temperature changes affect performance?

### Season Context
- How does this race fit into the championship battle?
- What are the implications for points standings?
- What lessons can be learned for future races at this track?

### Phase 4 Demo Script

"The Analytics module tells the complete story of each race. Select any of the 12 championship races and see an interactive timeline showing position changes, gap evolution, and key moments like pit stops and incidents.

Analyze strategic decisions - did pitting early help or hurt? See 'what-if' scenarios for alternative strategies. Performance heatmaps reveal sector-by-sector strengths throughout the race. The system automatically generates a race report highlighting defining moments, driver of the day, and championship implications."
